# JS animation

Experiments with drawing and animation in js frameworks:  
http://paperjs.org (haven't given paper too much love)  
https://p5js.org
three js could have a home here too

Project is built with webpack and using babel so I can use imports/exports and other es6 features ðŸŽ‰

## Starting a project

Branch off of the `project_base` branch which will not contain any animation js  
just the boilerplate tools, templates, and build process.

`master` contains animation projects - both the latest animation and archived animation.

## Structure

- `templates/` dir: 
contains a templates for js and html

js template is meant to be used as an example of a p5 project and non-p5. 
The two templates for html that are used in the webpack build, [one that is used for p5 projects](https://github.com/unjust/jsAnimation/blob/master/templates/template_p5.html) because it doesnt require a canvas element in the dom (p5 makes a canvas), the other for paper js.

- `js/` dir: each sketch has its own file - using the extension \*.p5.js right now will generate an html file using the p5 template when the project is built
  - `archive` dir: not a place for dead code! but for other finished projects
  - `utils` dir: for projects to visualize, debug etc
  - `myLib` dir: reusable code that I have written. Will build out to shapes, motions, etc
  - `libs` dir: for third party libs which need to be run through babel for module support
- `build/` dir: for built js (webpack/babel) and the generated html files

## Build process

There are separate webpack configs for dev and prod.  
the `dev` config builds everything and starts to watch the files.  
`prod` is configured more to just compile the js.  

### Commands

#### `yarn run dev`

`yarn run dev`. 
This will build the js files in the root of js (not archive or utils).
And will also start watching the files.

webpack looks in the js directory,  
for every js it creates and entry point based on the file name  
(eg `first` for `first.js`, `foo` for `foo.js` etc) 

https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin 
the the html plugin uses those entry points and creates an html file based on the appropriate html template in `templates/`.     
it appends the script tag to the bottom and interpolates basic template vars.

## JS setup
https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode
=======
You can also build with options**:  
  `--archive` `-a` build the archive directory js 
  `--file` `-f` just build one file 

** this feature needs to be checked and tested

#### `yarn run build_js`

Just builds the compiled js. 
Used by the build_push_to_site.workflow. 
to share the compiled js to the jekyll site.  

### Building docs 

There is a `gh-pages` branch in this repo that will show an index file with a table of contents of the html files in the build directory.
Uses the docs dir of gh-pages.

### Building the jekyll site

[There is a workflow](https://github.com/unjust/jsAnimation/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_push_to_site.yml) which will run on a push to  `unjustio_website_assets` branch. This workflow builds the project and pushes the assets over to `unjustio` repo.

Using the script [`push_to_website_assets.sh`](https://github.com/unjust/jsAnimation/blob/master/push_to_website_assets.sh) will push to the 
branch to trigger the workflow.
Then head over to https://github.com/unjust/unjustio to design the pages with the new assets.

Using the script [`push_to_website_local.sh`](https://github.com/unjust/jsAnimation/blob/master/push_to_website_local.sh) will push to the 
repo on my compu.
